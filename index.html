            Welcome to EliteWares Picture Editor, where cutting-edge photo editing meets 
            the needs of discerning photographers. Our software is meticulously crafted 
            to offer advanced editing capabilities, including powerful batch processing 
            features. It's every photographer's dream tool for effortlessly enhancing 
            numerous pictures, particularly portraits.
            Every year, schools across the country have graduations that require photographers to take hundreds of photos of children and then edit them individually to remove facial blemishes from the image, perform color correction, add custom frames to the images, and resize them for specific graduation packages. This process is very tedious and can take days or even weeks to complete depending on the number of images that have to be edited. Our software aims to improve the production speed of these photographers by performing these tedious edits on images in bulk allowing the user to complete what would take a week in just a day.
